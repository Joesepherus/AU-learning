# Hardhat Faucet

Can you think of any extra features to add to your faucet? How about some sort of way of keeping track of user addresses that have already used it? Or using timestamps to limit mass withdrawals all at once?

Did you notice Hardhat make things easier for us as developers? Or maybe harder? ðŸ‘€

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
